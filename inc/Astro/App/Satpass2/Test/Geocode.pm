=head1 NAME

Astro::App::Satpass2::Test::Geocode - Tests for geocode wrappers

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use lib qw{ inc };
 use Test::More 0.88;
 use Astro::App::Satpass2::Test::Geocode;
 setup 'Astro::App::Satpass2::Geocode::Geocoder::US';
 SKIP: {
     geocode '1600 Pennsylvania Ave, Washington DC', 1;
 }
 done_testing;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This package provides the boiler plate for testing the geocode wrapper
objects.

=head1 SUBROUTINES

The following subroutines are both prototyped and exported by default.

=head2 setup

 setup 'Astro::App::Satpass2::Geocoder::TomTom';

This subroutine loads both the specified class and the class
it wraps. Then it probes the web site that provides the geocoding
service. If any of these actions fails, a C<plan skip_all => $reason> is
issued, and no testing is done.

If we get this far, a test is run to see if the desired class can be
instantiated.

The prototype for this subroutine is C<($)>.

=head2 geocode

 SKIP: {
     geocode '1600 Pennsylvania Ave, Washington DC', 1;
 }

This subroutine attempts to geocode a location. The arguments are the
location to geocode and the number of tests to skip if the logic decides
a skip is called for. Yes, this subroutine must be wrapped in a SKIP
block.

The returned geocoding is not checked, because of the difficulty of
tracking database changes, and because if the wrapped class does not do
this (e.g.  L<Geo::Coder::OSM|Geo::Coder::OSM>) why should I?

The cases checked for and their outcomes are:

=over

=item setup failed or not called: skip

=item geocoding succeeded: pass

=item 500 error: skip

=item any other error: fail

=back

The prototype for this subroutine is C<($;$)>. The default for the
second argument (number of tests to skip) is C<1>.
