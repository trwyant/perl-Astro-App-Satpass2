=head1 TITLE

satpass2 - Script to wrap Astro::App::Satpass2 satellite prediction functionality.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 satpass2
 satpass2 'st spaceflight -all -eff' pass exit
 satpass2 <canned_commands.txt
 satpass2 -help
 satpass2 -version

=head1 OPTIONS

The available options are those of the L<Astro::App::Satpass2|Astro::App::Satpass2>
L<run()|Astro::App::Satpass2/run> method. Briefly and non-definitively,

=over

=item -filter

This option asserts that F<satpass2> is being run as a Unix filter, and
suppresses the front matter. It can be negated by specifying
C<-nofilter>. It is asserted by default if C<STDIN> is not an
interactive terminal.

=item -initialization_file filename

This option specifies an alternative initialization file. The synonym
C<-initfile> can also be used.

=item -gmt

This option specifies that times are to be displayed in GMT.

=item -help

This option causes the L<Astro::App::Satpass2|Astro::App::Satpass2>
L<help()|Astro::App::Satpass2/help> method to be run. The script then exits.

=item -version

This option causes the front matter (version and copyright) to be
displayed. The script then exits.

=back

=head1 DETAILS

This script is a wrapper for the L<Astro::App::Satpass2|Astro::App::Satpass2> package.
All it really does is to load the C<Astro::App::Satpass2> package and then call
its L<run()|Astro::App::Satpass2/run> method.

What you get is an application similar to the C<satpass> script packaged
with L<Astro::Coord::ECI|Astro::Coord::ECI>, but (hopefully!) more
flexible and easier to maintain.

The core functionality is the prediction of satellite passes over a
given location, plus the prediction of Iridium flares.

There are also a number of support functions. You can download orbital
data (via L<Astro::SpaceTrack|Astro::SpaceTrack>) from a number of
sources, or you can load it from a file or store it in a file. You can
define your own commands in terms of the existing ones. In the United
States, you can geocode observing locations to latitude and longitude,
and download your height above sea level from the U. S. Geological
Survey via module
L<Geo::WebService::Elevation::USGS|Geo::WebService::Elevation::USGS>.

Besides the restructuring of the code into an object, the largest change
from F<satpass> is the extremely flexible templating system used to
produce output. This should allow broad customization of output to meet
personal needs. See
L<Astro::App::Satpass2::Format::Classic|Astro::App::Satpass2::Format::Classic> for the
(unfortunately) gory details.
