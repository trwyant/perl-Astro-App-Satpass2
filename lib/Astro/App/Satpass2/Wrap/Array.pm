=head1 NAME

Astro::App::Satpass2::Wrap::Array - Wrap an array reference.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Astro::App::Satpass2::Wrap::Array;

 my @array = qw{ foo bar baz };
 my $wrap = Astro::App::Satpass2::Wrap::Array->new( \@array );
 foreach ( $wrap->dereference() ) {
     say;
 }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is private to the C<Astro-App-Satpass2> package. It can be
changed or revoked without notice. All documentation is for the benefit
of the author.

This class exists to mark arguments to C<Template-Toolkit> that, when
passed back through to other code, need to be dereferenced before use.

Well, honestly, it exists because I can't figure out how to get
C<Template-Toolkit> to do this on its own, and having all the relevant
C<Astro-App-Satpass2> methods simply expand all array references has too
many undesirable side effects. So what I intend to do is bless arguments
that are to be expanded into this class.

=head1 METHODS

This class supports the following public methods:

=head2 new

 my $wrap = Astro::App::Satpass2::Wrap::Array->new( \@foo );

This method instantiates the object. The array reference is required,
and that array reference is blessed into this class.

=head2 dereference

 my @array = $wrap->dereference();

This method returns the elements in the original array.

=head1 SUPPORT
