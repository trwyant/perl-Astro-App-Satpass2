=head1 NAME

Astro::App::Satpass2::Macro::Command - Define a macro which consists of an array of commands

=head1 SYNOPSIS

No user-serviceable parts inside.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is private to the Astro-App-Satpass2 distribution.
Documentation is for the benefit of the author only.

=head1 METHODS

This class provides the following methods overriding those of its
superclass:

=head2 init

The C<def> attribute is checked, and the C<implements> attribute
populated.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

This class adds the following attributes to the superclass:

=head2 def

This attribute is a reference to an array that contains the commands to
be executed when the macro is called. Substitution is done on these as
required.

The same-named method can be used to access this. The method returns an
array in list context, or an array reference in scalar context. Either
way the return is a copy of the definition; you can not access (and
therefore modify) the commands issued by the macro using the data
returned by this method.

=head1 SEE ALSO
