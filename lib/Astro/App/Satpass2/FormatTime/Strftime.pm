=head1 DESCRIPTION

This package provides common functionality for strftime-based time
formatters. Since the actual implementation may vary, what we really
have here is a repository for common formats. These are implemented as
manifest constants (i.e. C<use constant>), but are documented below as
methods.

=head1 MANIFEST CONSTANTS

This class supports the following manifest constants, which are all
exported by default:

=head2 DATE_FORMAT

This manifest constant returns a date format designed to produce a
numeric date in the format year-month-day. Since this format is intended
to be used with C<strftime()>, it is C<'%Y-%m-%d'>.

=head2 FORMAT_TYPE

This manifest constant returns the type of format expected by the
formatter. This class returns C<'strftime'>.

=head2 ISO_8601_FORMAT

This manifest constant returns a date format designed to produce a date
and time in ISO 8601 format, in the Universal/GMT time zone. Since this
format is intended to be used with C<strftime()>, it is
C<'%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ'>.

=head2 TIME_FORMAT

This manifest constant returns a date format designed to produce a time
in the format hour:minute:second.  Since this format is intended to be
used with C<strftime()>, it is C<'%H:%M:%S'>.
