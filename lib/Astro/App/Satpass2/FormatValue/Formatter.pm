This Perl class should be considered private to the

class without notice.

This Perl class encapsulates the construction of individual formatter
routines for the use of the
L<Astro::App::Satpass2::FormatValue|Astro::App::Satpass2::FormatValue>
object. It is called to construct that class' built-in formatters, and
by that class'
L<add_formatter_method()|Astro::App::Satpass2::FormatValue/add_formatter_method>
method to add user-defined formatter methods. It is not instantiated by
the user.

This static method instantiates the object. Besides the invocant, its
argument is a reference to a hash that describes the formatter.

=head2 code

This method returns the code that implements the formatter.

=head2 name
