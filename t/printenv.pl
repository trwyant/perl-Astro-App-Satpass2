=head1 TITLE

printenv.pl - Print environment variables

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 printenv.pl
 printenv.pl PATH

=head1 OPTIONS

None.

=head1 DETAILS

This Perl script mimics (more or less) the Unix C<printenv> command,
which prints the names and values of environment variables. You can
specify the names of the environment variables you want printed; if you
specify none, all are printed.

Unlike C<printenv> you can specify multiple names. Names that are not
defined will not be printed, and the exit status is the number of
undefined names.
