  Require Scalar::Util version 1.25, since that is the version that
    supports dualvar(), which is needed for the body-specific pass
    events added in 0.016.

  Try to get better diagnostics for the occasional load failures
    reported by CPAN testers.

0.016		2014-01-20	T. R. Wyant
  Make the rounding of time for display configurable. The default is to
    round to the nearest second.
  Support body-specific pass events. This is really in support of a
    project to predict sounding rocket visibility based on published KMZ
    files for the launch.
  Add options to the quarters() method to select which are displayed.
  Add eg/quarters_vcalendar.
  In Astro::App::Satpass2::FormatValue:
    Add formatter method list() to handle TLE output. Handle individual
      lines of the list with sub-templates.
    Build time formats when used. This to allow subclasses to add time
      formatters.
  "Code macro" support tweaks. This is all still experimental:
    Add method Astro::App::Satpass2->__add_to_observing_list().
    Call code macro after_load() (if it exists) after loading the
      macros.
    If a code macro is loaded using the -lib option, record the absolute
      path to the directory unless -relative also asserted.
  Fix Astro::App::Satpass2::Format::Dump. No telling how long it was
    broken.

  Have the expansion of ~~ throw an exception if the configuration
    directory does not exist. Skip test of ~~ expansion in this case.
  Improve tests that compare path to expected, to handle better the case
    where the path contains a symbolic link.

0.013_01	2013-10-06	T. R. Wyant
  Fixed failure in Astro::App::Satpass2::Format->decode(
    'desired_equinox_dynamical' ) when the value was not 0.
  In file name expansion, made ~~/... expand to configuration directory.
  Added the ability to implement a macro as Perl code. These are handled
    by Astro::App::Satpass2::Macro::Code. The corresponding satpass2
    syntax is 'macro load Module_name'. Document this in TUTORIAL.
  Updated required version of Astro::SpaceTrack to one that supports the
    REST interface.
  Require Astro::Coord::ECI 0.57 because of the international launch
    designator problems introduced in 0.051_01.
  Make load_package() optionally callable as a method so it can use the
    same error reporting mechanism as everyone else if it is available.
  Add options to the load_package() calling sequence: lib (which
    directory to add to @INC), complain (how to report validation
    failures), and fatal (whether and how to report failures to load the
    module). A true value of 'fatal' causes the failure not to be cached
    so that another load of the module will produce the same failure.
  Made $satpass2->time_parser( base => ... ) both parse an input time
    and return a formatted time.
  Made time parsing conform to the documentation in that if the time was
    defaulted, the default sets the base time for the parser.
  Implement Astro::App::Satpass2 method sky( lookup => ... ) in terms of
    the Astro::SIMBAD::Client script method rather than the query()
    method, since the former does not use SOAP::Lite.

0.013		2013-02-14	T. R. Wyant
  On failures in t/parse_time_date_manip_*.t, dump the zone of the

  Require File::HomeDir 0.93, since we are using my_dist_config().

0.012_05	2013-02-03	T. R. Wyant
  Further tweak dumping of Date::Manip info in tests, in the hope of
    getting enough information to actually diagnose test failures.
  Eliminate warnings in t/parse_time_date_manip_5.t if Date::Manip v5 is
    being used (rather than Date::Manip 6's DM5 back end).

0.012_04	2013-01-30	T. R. Wyant
  Bypass Date::Manip::DM5 testing under MSWin32, since it fails and I

  Put traps in t/parse_time_date_manip_5.t to try to figure out where

  Fix warning thrown when there is no configuration directory.

0.012_02	2013-01-20	T. R. Wyant
  Correct problem with configuring (and dumping the configuration of)
    the time parser. The formatter object was being accessed instead.
    This has apparantly been present since pretty much the beginning.
  Make the time_parser class of record
    Astro::App::Satpass2::ParseTime::Date::Manip rather than ::v5 or
    ::v6, since we have no control over the environment variables in
    effect when we are launched, and thus, if Date::Manip 6 is
    installed, which back end is in use.
  Redo Astro::App::Satpass2::ParseTime::Date::Manip logic so that if
    Date::Manip 6 is initialized in DM5 mode calls to it get routed
    through Astro::App::Satpass2::ParseTime::Date::Manip::v5. This was
    causing failures under Perl 5.8.

0.012_01	2013-01-13	T. R. Wyant
  Make 'input redirection' (<file) work, but more like `file`; that is,
    the contents of the file become a token at that point in the
    command.
  Make Astro::App::Satpass2::FormatValue more amenable to subclassing,
    though subclassing is still unsupported.
  Give Astro::App::Satpass2::Format a 'value_formatter' attribute to
    control what class (or object) is used for formatting values.

    eg/{pass,flare}_vcalendar, at a minute before the nominal event.

  Another crack at properly testing if two files are in fact the same.
  Tweak eg/pass_vcalendar to work with Mac OS 10.8 calendar.
  Add attribute 'permissive' (and associated accessor/mutator
    permissive()) to Astro::App::Satpass2::Format::Template. This
    defaults to false, If set true, Template-Toolkit is configured to
    accept absolute path names for templates.

    LWP::Protocol::implementor().

  Make Astro::App::Satpass2::ParseTime::ISO8601 less permissive in
    allowing deviations from strict ISO-8601 format. Specifically, allow
    a maximum of 1 non-digit character separating the date and the time.
  Fix failure of Astro::App::Satpass2 to propagate its 'warning'
    attribute to helper classes.
  Allow the Astro::App::Satpass2 time_parser attribute to be set to
    'Date::Manip'. This selects either 'Date::Manip::v5' or
    'Date::Manip::v6' depending on what is installed.
  In testing, treat a 500 error from a geocode server as a 'skip' rather
    than a failure, since I have no control over whether the server is
    up.
  Add explicit test for DateTime in t/format_value.t. Some Perl 5.8.8s
    were, for reasons not understood by me, running the time zone test
    even when DateTime was not present.

0.000_38	2012-01-19	T. R. Wyant
  Add attribute pass_threshold to Astro::App::Satpass2. The pass()
    method passes this attribute through to the same-named attribute of
    the relevant Astro::Coord::ECI::TLE objects.
  Fixed bug with the manipulation of Astro::App::Satpass2 helper objects
    which was introduced in version 0.000_36. The only known
    manifestation of this bug was in failure of the Astro::App::Satpass2
    save() method.

  Reformat subroutine attributes for older Perls, which seem to get
    confused if they are not all on one line.
  Require IO::File 1.14, since it appears that 1.13 does not understand
    opening a scalar reference.
  Correct the code that loads either Time::y2038 or Time::Local, which
    was loading both under some circumstances.
  Implement the Astro::App::Satpass zero-argument cd() via
    File::HomeDir->my_home(), for repeatability in testing.
  Some older Perls complain about explicitly assigning undef to a
    variable under 'use warnings', so apply 'no warnings qw{ undef }' as
    needed.
  In code that optionally uses YAML, just use YAML::Any instead of
    feeling around for a usable version.
  Astro::App::Satpass2 startup time optimizations, typically by
    deferring the loading of modules until they are needed.
  Make Changes file comply with Test::CPAN::Changes, and add author test

  Add title_gravity mutator to Astro::App::Satpass2::FormatValue. This
    controls whether multiline titles are aligned to the top or bottom
    of their space.
  Add 'literal' formatter argument to Astro::App::Satpass2::FormatValue.
    This gives a way to get a literal string inserted and made the same
    width as the underlying datum would be. Previously, this was done
    using the 'title' object, but that is no longer useful if the
    title_gravity is set to 'bottom'.
  Require Perl 5.8 or higher. The code would never actually run under
    5.6, since it uses the 'open scalar reference' functionality
    introduced in Perl 5.8.
  Normalize Astro::App::Satpass2 file input. The init(), load(), and
    source() methods now all take a file name, a URL (disambiguated from
    a file name using URI::URL), a scalar reference, an array reference,
    or a code reference (that returns one line each time it is called).
    URLs do not work unless LWP::UserAgent and URI::URL are installed.
  Add missing version number to Astro::App::Satpass2::FormatValue.

0.000_33	2011-12-23	T. R. Wyant

  Have Astro::App::Satpass2::ParseTime::ISO8601->tz() regard an invalid
    time zone as a warning rather than an error, and equivalent to the
    system's local time zone (i.e. $ENV{TZ} = undef).
  Make expansion of parameters re-tokenize more like Bash.
  Correct t/tokenize.t to use File::HomeDir->my_home() rather than
    getpwuid in the tilde expansion tests.
  Have Astro::App::Satpass2::Warner ignore the Astro::App::Satpass2
    modules when carping or croaking.
  Override the system's $ENV{TZ} in t/format.t, since the tests
    explicitly require this to be undefined.
  Have t/basic.t display $ENV{TZ} for future reference.
  Correct Astro::App::Satpass2 optional module documentation to reflect
    the current state of the code.
