  Workaround for Date::Manip bug 80435: Date::Manip clobbers $ENV{PATH}
    on *nix.

  Have the Astro::App::Satpass2 spacetrack() method _not_ pass the
    options hash to Astro::SpaceTrack method spacetrack_query_v2().

  Fix MSWin32 test failures due to equivocation on which slash is used
    for a path delimiter.
  Skip output redirection test under MSWin32. I think the failure is a
    testing problem, but am not sure, so a note was added to the docs on
    this.

0.007_03	2012-09-19	T. R. Wyant
  Another fix to floating-point formatting normalization.

0.007_02	2012-09-18	T. R. Wyant
  Correct typo in core dependencies. Add author test to try to prevent
    this from happening again.

0.007_01	2012-09-18	T. R. Wyant
  Try to address CPAN testers failures (unable to load 'strict'), by
    including all core dependencies, and by removing pragmas from a
    helper script.

  Suppress 'OK' output in response to Astro::App::Satpass2 method
    spacetrack( set => ... ).

0.006		2012-09-05	T. R. Wyant
  Warn on every use of the 'lit' attribute. This should have been
    warning on first use before, but was not.
  Fix uninitialized value error in Astro::App::Satpass2 when running
    choose() on bodies that do not have a name.
  Add support for displaying TLEs in JSON format. See eg/tle_json.tt for
    an example.
  Add Astro::App::Satpass2 attribute almanac_horizon, which corresponds
    to the same-named Astro::Coord::ECI attribute.
  Track effect of change in the way Astro::Coord::ECI::TLE formats the
    effective date on the tests in t/format_value.t.

0.005		2012-06-22	T. R. Wyant
  Have the Astro::App::Satpass2 init() method only throw an exception if
    the file name was explicitly specified.

0.004_01	2012-06-10	T. R. Wyant
  The Astro::App::Satpass2 spacetrack() method was not reporting failure
    if the request failed.
  Try to address test failures in t/whole_app.t under freebsd.

0.004		2012-06-02	T. R. Wyant
  Replace YAML::Any with just YAML. They come in the same distro, and
    just plain YAML does not suffer from deprecation warnings.
  Don't use URI::URL to validate urls for Astro::App::Satpass2 init(),
    load(), and source() methods. Instead, use URI and
    LWP::Protocol::implementor().
  Documentation review - Astrp::App::Satpass2,
    Astro::App::Satpass2::FormatTime::DateTime::Cldr, and the TUTORIAL.

0.003		2012-05-04	T. R. Wyant
  In Astro::App::Satpass2:
  * Remove the status() method's 'iridium' subcommand, to remain
    compatible with the 'satpass' script in Astro-satpass.

0.002		2012-03-15	T. R. Wyant
  In Astro::App::Satpass2:
  * Add method station() to return an object representing the current
    observer.
  * Have the choose() and drop() methods throw an exception if they
    would leave the observing list empty.
  * Convert to use the new Astro::Coord::ECI 'station' attribute.

0.001		2012-02-05	T. R. Wyant
  Add interactive method pwd() to Astro::App::Satpass2.
  Make the test skip messages for missing geocoder modules like all the
    other skip messages for missing modules.

0.000_39	2012-01-24	T. R. Wyant
  Make Astro::App::Satpass2::ParseTime::ISO8601 less permissive in
    allowing deviations from strict ISO-8601 format. Specifically, allow
    a maximum of 1 non-digit character separating the date and the time.
  Fix failure of Astro::App::Satpass2 to propagate its 'warning'
    attribute to helper classes.
  Allow the Astro::App::Satpass2 time_parser attribute to be set to
    'Date::Manip'. This selects either 'Date::Manip::v5' or
    'Date::Manip::v6' depending on what is installed.
  In testing, treat a 500 error from a geocode server as a 'skip' rather
    than a failure, since I have no control over whether the server is
    up.
  Add explicit test for DateTime in t/format_value.t. Some Perl 5.8.8s
    were, for reasons not understood by me, running the time zone test
    even when DateTime was not present.

0.000_38	2012-01-19	T. R. Wyant
  Add attribute pass_threshold to Astro::App::Satpass2. The pass()
    method passes this attribute through to the same-named attribute of
    the relevant Astro::Coord::ECI::TLE objects.
  Fixed bug with the manipulation of Astro::App::Satpass2 helper objects
    which was introduced in version 0.000_36. The only known
    manifestation of this bug was in failure of the Astro::App::Satpass2
    save() method.

0.000_37	2012-01-16	T. R. Wyant
  Have the tests of the geocoder wrapper classes simply test for success
    rather than actual location returned (which is the wrapped class'
    job). This to eliminate test failures when the service changes its
    database.

0.000_36	2012-01-14	T. R. Wyant
  Reformat subroutine attributes for older Perls, which seem to get
    confused if they are not all on one line.
  Require IO::File 1.14, since it appears that 1.13 does not understand
    opening a scalar reference.
  Correct the code that loads either Time::y2038 or Time::Local, which
    was loading both under some circumstances.
  Implement the Astro::App::Satpass zero-argument cd() via
    File::HomeDir->my_home(), for repeatability in testing.
  Some older Perls complain about explicitly assigning undef to a
    variable under 'use warnings', so apply 'no warnings qw{ undef }' as
    needed.
  In code that optionally uses YAML, just use YAML::Any instead of
    feeling around for a usable version.
  Astro::App::Satpass2 startup time optimizations, typically by
    deferring the loading of modules until they are needed.
  Make Changes file comply with Test::CPAN::Changes, and add author test
    xt/author/changes.t to ensure it remains so.

0.000_35	2011-12-30	T. R. Wyant
  Double quote arguments in eg/pass_vcalendar and eg/flare_vcalendar, to
    go along with the tokenizer change in 0.000_31.

0.000_34	2011-12-28	T. R. Wyant
  Add title_gravity mutator to Astro::App::Satpass2::FormatValue. This
    controls whether multiline titles are aligned to the top or bottom
    of their space.
  Add 'literal' formatter argument to Astro::App::Satpass2::FormatValue.
    This gives a way to get a literal string inserted and made the same
    width as the underlying datum would be. Previously, this was done
    using the 'title' object, but that is no longer useful if the
    title_gravity is set to 'bottom'.
  Require Perl 5.8 or higher. The code would never actually run under
    5.6, since it uses the 'open scalar reference' functionality
    introduced in Perl 5.8.
  Normalize Astro::App::Satpass2 file input. The init(), load(), and
    source() methods now all take a file name, a URL (disambiguated from
    a file name using URI::URL), a scalar reference, an array reference,
    or a code reference (that returns one line each time it is called).
    URLs do not work unless LWP::UserAgent and URI::URL are installed.
  Add missing version number to Astro::App::Satpass2::FormatValue.

0.000_33	2011-12-23	T. R. Wyant
  Add options -exclude and -status to Astro::App::Satpass2 spacetrack()
    method, so they get passed through to the Astro::SpaceTrack object.

0.000_32	2011-12-07	T. R. Wyant
  Correct t/whole_app.t to use File::HomeDir->my_home() rather than
    getpwuid in the tilde expansion tests.

0.000_31	2011-12-06	T. R. Wyant
  Have Astro::App::Satpass2::ParseTime::ISO8601->tz() regard an invalid
    time zone as a warning rather than an error, and equivalent to the
    system's local time zone (i.e. $ENV{TZ} = undef).
  Make expansion of parameters re-tokenize more like Bash.
  Correct t/tokenize.t to use File::HomeDir->my_home() rather than
    getpwuid in the tilde expansion tests.
  Have Astro::App::Satpass2::Warner ignore the Astro::App::Satpass2
    modules when carping or croaking.
  Override the system's $ENV{TZ} in t/format.t, since the tests
    explicitly require this to be undefined.
  Have t/basic.t display $ENV{TZ} for future reference.
  Correct Astro::App::Satpass2 optional module documentation to reflect
    the current state of the code.

0.000_30	2011-12-05	T. R. Wyant
  Initial release to CPAN.
