  Reformat subroutine attributes for older Perls, which seem to get
    confused if they are not all on one line.
  Require IO::File 1.14, since it appears that 1.13 does not understand
    opening a scalar reference.
  Correct the code that loads either Time::y2038 or Time::Local, which
    was loading both under some circumstances.
  Implement the Astro::App::Satpass zero-argument cd() via
    File::HomeDir->my_home(), for repeatability in testing.
  Some older Perls complain about explicitly assigning undef to a
    variable under 'use warnings', so apply 'no warnings qw{ undef }' as
    needed.
  In code that optionally uses YAML, just use YAML::Any instead of
    feeling around for a usable version.
  Astro::App::Satpass2 startup time optimizations, typically by
    deferring the loading of modules until they are needed.
  Make Changes file comply with Test::CPAN::Changes, and add author test
    xt/author/changes.t to ensure it remains so.

  Double quote arguments in eg/pass_vcalendar and eg/flare_vcalendar, to
    go along with the tokenizer change in 0.000_31.

  Add title_gravity mutator to Astro::App::Satpass2::FormatValue. This
    controls whether multiline titles are aligned to the top or bottom
    of their space.
  Add 'literal' formatter argument to Astro::App::Satpass2::FormatValue.
    This gives a way to get a literal string inserted and made the same
    width as the underlying datum would be. Previously, this was done
    using the 'title' object, but that is no longer useful if the
    title_gravity is set to 'bottom'.
  Require Perl 5.8 or higher. The code would never actually run under
    5.6, since it uses the 'open scalar reference' functionality
    introduced in Perl 5.8.
  Normalize Astro::App::Satpass2 file input. The init(), load(), and
    source() methods now all take a file name, a URL (disambiguated from
    a file name using URI::URL), a scalar reference, an array reference,
    or a code reference (that returns one line each time it is called).
    URLs do not work unless LWP::UserAgent and URI::URL are installed.
  Add missing version number to Astro::App::Satpass2::FormatValue.

  Add options -exclude and -status to Astro::App::Satpass2 spacetrack()
    method, so they get passed through to the Astro::SpaceTrack object.

  Correct t/whole_app.t to use File::HomeDir->my_home() rather than
    getpwuid in the tilde expansion tests.

0.000_31	2011-12-06	T. R. Wyant
  Have Astro::App::Satpass2::ParseTime::ISO8601->tz() regard an invalid
    time zone as a warning rather than an error, and equivalent to the
    system's local time zone (i.e. $ENV{TZ} = undef).
  Make expansion of parameters re-tokenize more like Bash.
  Correct t/tokenize.t to use File::HomeDir->my_home() rather than
    getpwuid in the tilde expansion tests.
  Have Astro::App::Satpass2::Warner ignore the Astro::App::Satpass2
    modules when carping or croaking.
  Override the system's $ENV{TZ} in t/format.t, since the tests
    explicitly require this to be undefined.
  Have t/basic.t display $ENV{TZ} for future reference.
  Correct Astro::App::Satpass2 optional module documentation to reflect
    the current state of the code.

  Initial release to CPAN.
