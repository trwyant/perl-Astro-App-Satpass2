# Do quarter calculations, displaying the results in vCalendar format. The
# output may be redirected to a .vcal file. The start and end dates for the
# pass calculation can be passed as arguments to the 'source' statement, and
# default to 'today noon' and '+8' respectively.  This whole thing (less the
# comments) could be wrapped up as a macro if desired.

#	CAVEAT: My ancient Palm desktop software appears not to properly
#	handle the switch between normal and daylight-saving  time
#	(a.k.a. summer time), in that predictions made before the switch
#	for events after the switch get assigned the wrong time, even
#	though the UT event time is correct in the emitted file. I have
#	not changed the event times to local time eg/flare_vcalendar
#	because the vcalendar standard specifies UT.
