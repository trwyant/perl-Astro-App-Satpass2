# Do satellite pass calculations, displaying the results in vCalendar
# format. The output may be redirected to a .vcal file. The start and
# end dates for the pass calculation can be passed as arguments to the
# 'source' statement, and default to 'today noon' and '+8' respectively.
# This whole thing (less the comments) could be wrapped up as a macro
# if desired.

#	CAVEAT: My ancient Palm desktop software appears not to properly
#	handle the switch between normal and daylight-saving  time
#	(a.k.a. summer time), in that predictions made before the switch
#	for events after the switch get assigned the wrong time, even
#	though the UT event time is correct in the emitted file. I have
#	not changed the event times to local time eg/flare_vcalendar
#	because the vcalendar standard specifies UT.

# SHOULD NOT be longer than 75 octets (NOT characters) excluding the
# line break, and longer lines SHOULD be broken.

# be saved as a .ics file to be successfully imported into the calendar
